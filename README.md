=====================

This plugin uses Tml PHP Client SDK to enable inline translations of WordPress posts and page contents.


Installation
==================





Integration
==================

Now we can active the plugin by logging into to WordPress with an admin account and navigate to the Plugins section.

You should now see the Translation Exchange plugin as one of the options.

Click on the "Activate" link. You should see now a new section on the left bar called "Translation Exchange".

Before proceeding further, please visit https://dashboard.translationexchange.com/signup, register as a new user and create a project.

Copy your project token.

Update WordPress plugin with your project token and save settings.

After you save the changes, you can add a language selector widget to your WordPress UI by visiting the Appearance > Widgets section.

The Language Selector allows users to change languages of WordPress and your posts.

Now you are ready to invite translators and translate your blogs. By enabling inline translations, you can translate the site in-context.
